# ssh-list

## Installation

### MacOS

```bash
brew tap tchoupinax/ssh-list
brew install tchoupinax/ssh-list
```

```
brew tap adds more repos to the list of formulae that brew tracks, updates, and installs from

brew tap <user>/<repo> makes a shallow clone of the repository at https://github.com/user/homebrew-repo. Note that brew tap prefixes the repo name with "homebrew-". After that, brew will be able to work on those formulae as if they were in Homebrew's canonical repository

The full documentation can be found here with all the available options.
